  <h2>A DIVERSE NATION WITH RICH CULTURE AND TRADITIONS</h2>
<pre>
  <p1>From kashmir to kanyakumari,rann of kutch to assam it has varied traditions,cultures,languages,and re;igions followed.back in timeline this country has witnessed harsh colonial rule which led to massive disrtruction of cultural evidences by mughals and the british.today,it is tring to regain its past richness.Within families, there is a clear order of social precedence and influence based on gender, age, and, in the case of a woman, the number of her male children. The senior male of the household—whether father, grandfather, or uncle—typically is the recognized family head, and his wife is the person who regulates the tasks assigned to female family members. Males enjoy higher status than females; boys are often pampered while girls are relatively neglected. This is reflected in significantly different rates of mortality and morbidity between the sexes, allegedly (though reliable statistics are lacking) in occasional female infanticide, and increasingly in the abortion of female fetuses following prenatal gender testing. This pattern of preference is largely connected to the institution of dowry, since the family’s obligation to provide a suitable dowry to the bride’s new family represents a major financial liability. </p1>

 <h2>COUNTY'S UNITY IN DIVERSITY</h2>
 <p2>Indian culture is the heritage of social norms and technologies that originated in or are associated with the ethno-linguistically diverse India, pertaining to the Indian subcontinent until 1947 and the Republic of India post-1947. The term also applies beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India by immigration, colonisation, or influence, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. India's languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food, and customs differ from place to place within the country.

Indian culture, often labelled as a combination of several cultures, has been influenced by a history that is several millennia old, beginning with the Indus Valley Civilization and other early cultural areas.[1][2] Many elements of Indian culture, such as Indian religions, mathematics, philosophy, cuisine, languages, dance, music, and movies have had a profound impact across the Indosphere, Greater India, and the world according to Jean Przyluski, there is evidence for regional influence from Austroasiatic (Mon Khmer) groups on certain cultural and political elements of Ancient India, which may have arrived together with the spread of rice cultivation from Mainland Southeast Asia. An ethnic minority in Eastern India is still speaking Austroasiatic languages, most notably the Munda languages.[3][4] The British Raj further influenced Indian culture, such as through the widespread introduction of the English language,[5] and a local dialect developed.
